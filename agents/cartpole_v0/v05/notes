Same as v04 but increasing both frequency of updates
and minibatch size by 4x again.

This agent is even better than v04! It is significantly
more stable in the long tail of training while still
maintaining comparable performance. The reward, loss,
and initial value curves for this agent are very smooth.

We'll try increasin the speed of learning next by increasing
the learning rate.
