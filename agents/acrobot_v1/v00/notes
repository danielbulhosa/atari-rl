We found agent cartpole_v0/v05 to be the fastest learner
(even though it significantly overestimates the Q function
over time). We are using it as a starting point for this
environment.

Best checkpoint was #35 which achieves an average score of
about -84 which is decent. A better model would probably do
significantly better.
