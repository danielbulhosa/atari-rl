Doing double DQN like in v08 and v07 but with a
target update frequency of 500.

This case ended up being much closer to the 1000
case than the 100 case in terms of value function
divergence. However the convergence was much faster.
The value function didn't quite converge to the true
optimal values though. We will try a higher update
frequency.
