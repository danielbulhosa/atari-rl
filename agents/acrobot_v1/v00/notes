We use the same agent as we used for cartpole-v0, which
worked pretty well in that case. It worked pretty decently
in this one as well.

Our best checkpoint achieved an average of -84 which was
pretty good. In the first 100 episodes our best score was
probably around 90 which is not bad, in comparison to
other scores in the leaderboards. Leaderboard agents
likely had more sophisticated models.
