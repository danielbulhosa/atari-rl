Same as v09, v08, and v07 but with a target model
update frequency of 250.

The value function diverged more slowly but it still
went beyond the optimal value. It didn't converge as
nicely as the 500 case but converged better than the
1000 case. We think an update frequency between 250
and 500 probably makes sense.
