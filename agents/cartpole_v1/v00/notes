We use the same agent as we used for cartpole-v0, which
worked pretty well in that case. It worked pretty decently
in this one as well.

As there are no leaderboard results for this environment
we do not compare our score to any others. It took significantly
longer for the agent to solve this environment. We think
the small network likely has a hard time modeling Q values
over longer episodes. A better model we think would do much
better.
